# Professional Blog & Portfolio

## What This Is

A professional blog and portfolio platform that showcases both written essays and project work, inspired by Y Combinator founder blogs. Combines the timeless aesthetic of classic web publishing with modern performance and discoverability, using Times New Roman typography for a clean, professional presentation.

## Core Value

Effortless writing experience — prioritize making it easy to create and publish content. Everything else serves this goal.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Display blog posts with excellent reading experience (typography perfection, reading time, progress indicators, table of contents)
- [ ] Showcase projects with problem/solution narratives and live demo/GitHub links
- [ ] Fast performance with sub-second page loads (optimized delivery, edge caching, minimal bundles)
- [ ] SEO excellence (meta tags, structured data, OpenGraph, Twitter cards, sitemap)
- [ ] Analytics and content insights (track views, engagement, popular content)
- [ ] Clean, professional design using Times New Roman (regular) and Times New Roman Bold Italic (headings)
- [ ] Easy content creation workflow (write, publish, iterate quickly)

### Out of Scope

- Comments system — no user-generated content, discussions, or social features (keeps focus on writing, not moderation)
- Newsletter/email subscriptions — focus on content quality over list building (readers can use RSS or bookmark)
- Multi-author support — single author platform, no collaboration features (simplifies architecture and workflow)

## Context

**Design inspiration:** Combination of Y Combinator founder blog styles — Paul Graham's essay-focused minimalism with Patrick Collison's organized content curation.

**Dual purpose:** Establish professional credibility as a builder and thinker while sharing ideas. Projects section tells the story behind what you've built, blog section shares insights and thinking.

**Projects approach:** Focus on narrative (what problem, why you built it, what you learned) with working examples and source code links. Less technical stack showcase, more storytelling.

**Target audience:** Potential collaborators, employers, fellow builders, and readers interested in your work and ideas.

## Constraints

- **Philosophy**: Optimize for writing experience first — technical choices should make publishing effortless, not create friction

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Times New Roman typography | Classic, professional, highly readable — timeless aesthetic that emphasizes content over design trends | — Pending |
| No comments/newsletter in v1 | Maximize focus on content creation, minimize maintenance overhead and distraction from core writing experience | — Pending |
| World-class features (performance, SEO, analytics, reading experience) | Professional credibility requires excellent execution — half-built features undermine the brand | — Pending |
